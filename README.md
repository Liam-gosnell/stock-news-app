# stock-news-app

This project is built with Python. Stock News Monitoring Project.

This Python App is connected to a Stock API, News API & Twilio. The python code pulls data from the API's & when the "TSLA" stock has risen by a certain percentage ie"-5%" Twilio will send an SMS message to my phone with information on the stock drop / increase along with the News of why it happened.
